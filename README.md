# CancerCovid_Characterisations

Code for characterising  patients on a number of variables.

The frequency of screening appointments (specific to breast, colorectal, lung and prostate cancer), diagnostic tests (specific to each cancer) and GP consultations attended, baseline characteristics, measurements and procedures, will be calculated at multiple time points (before, during and after the COVID-19 lockdown) in the general population (denominator), and in separate populations of breast, colorectal, lung and prostate cancer patients. Significant differences in the frequencies of these variables across time points will be estimated by observing the standardised mean difference.

Characterisation includes standard charactersitics using OHDSI's 'Feature' Extraction' package, as well as bespoke characterisations for cancer specific variables.
